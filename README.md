# CS303-Assignment-1
This code uses a file of integers called integer_file.txt which contains the integers 1-100 for testing purposes. 
The file can be changed freely, as long as the quantity of integers remains 100.

Instructions to run code with Visual Studio:

1. Open Visual Studio, and create a new project.

2. Copy ModifyArray.cpp ***and*** driver.cpp to Source Files in solution explorer.

3. Copy ModifyArray.h to Header Files in solution explorer.

4. Copy integer_file.txt to Resource Files in solution explorer.

5. Click either the Local Windows Debugger or Start Without Debugging (Ctrl + F5) button.
